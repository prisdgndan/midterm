	<img src="cheer.jpg">
	<p>Cheerleading is a sport. From it began cheerleading invloved being at various sport events and pep rallys to cheer on teams. This did not mean that they were on the sidelines. Cheerleading invloves the same components of preparation as regular sports such as football and basketball. A spotless performance involves many hours of practice and training. Because cheerleading has renmants of dance and gymnastics a lot of the training is technical and takes a lot more effort. A performance alone last for 30 seconds to a minute but involves so many intricate details that it can take months to prepare even half of the performance.</p><br>
	<p>Injuries are also very prevelant. One fall from the average pyramid can result in injuries from <b>concussions to broke bones.</b></p><br>
	<p>On the contrary, cheerleading is <i>not</i> considered a sport because of the inability to compete against an opponent. It is mainly an activity that involves physical acts of stunting, dancing and tumbling. Cheerleading is a powerful performance that only impresses the audience. It is possible that there are cheerleading competitions but the teams earn their points by judgements. Contestants are not really interacting with other on the field.</p>
